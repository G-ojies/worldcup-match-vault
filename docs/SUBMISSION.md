# Superteam Earn — Submission Answers

Ready-to-paste answers for the TxODDS "Prediction Markets and Settlement" submission form.
Fill the bracketed links before submitting.

**Project name:** GreYat WorldCup Analytics

**One-line pitch:** On-chain World Cup prediction markets on Solana that settle trustlessly from
TxLINE's signed score data — markets resolve via a CPI into TxODDS's `validate_stat`, with no oracle
authority.

## Brief technical documentation

**Core idea.** Most prediction markets resolve by trusting an off-chain oracle. GreYat WorldCup Analytics
settles by *proving* the final score against TxODDS's own on-chain Merkle root. The settlement
instruction `resolve_market_trustless` CPIs into TxLINE's `validate_stat`, reads the returned boolean
via `get_return_data`, and releases escrowed SOL only if the proof verifies. Resolution is
permissionless and a false claim reverts — there is no trusted authority in the settlement path.

**Technical highlights.**
- Custom Anchor settlement engine: derives the outcome predicate (`home − away >0/<0/=0`) and binds
  it to the claimed result, the market's `fixture_id`, the goal stat-keys, and a full-time finality
  gate before invoking `validate_stat`.
- IDL-mirrored CPI types + `get_return_data` decoding of the returned `bool`.
- Verifiable Resolution UI: renders the Merkle-proof "receipt" (proven stat leaves, predicate, proof
  nodes, daily-root PDA) and links the on-chain settlement tx.
- Validated live on devnet against a real World Cup fixture (NED 1‑1 MAR → Draw).
- 7 passing LiteSVM tests; full devnet e2e (create → bet → trustless settle → claim).

**Business highlight.** Trustless settlement removes the single biggest counterparty risk in
prediction markets (a dishonest/compromised oracle), which is exactly what makes on-chain sportsbooks
and parametric prop-bets safe to scale on TxLINE.

**TxLINE endpoints used.**
- `POST /auth/guest/start`, on-chain `subscribe(1,4)`, `POST /api/token/activate` (free World Cup tier)
- `GET /api/fixtures/snapshot` — markets
- `GET /api/scores/snapshot/{fixtureId}`, `GET /api/scores/historical/{fixtureId}` — final score + seq
- `GET /api/scores/stat-validation` — three-stage Merkle proof (settlement input)
- `GET /api/scores/stream`, `GET /api/odds/stream` — live feed (proxied)
- on-chain `validate_stat` (CPI) — trustless settlement check

## Feedback (experience using the TxLINE API)

See [FEEDBACK.md](../FEEDBACK.md). Short version: `validate_stat` is an excellent settlement primitive
and the free devnet World Cup tier is a great on-ramp; the main friction was an unreliable `GameState`
field (had to use `Action: game_finalised` + `Score.Total`), missing per-field REST schemas, and a few
proof-JSON↔IDL field-name mismatches worth documenting.
